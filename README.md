# python-api-challenge
In this repository, you should find the VacationPy.ipynb and WeatherPy.ipynb which 
reflects my code. AskBCS helped me to debug a few times when my code was not working, 
but the code is my own. VacationPyTemplate.ipynb and WeatherPyTemplate.ipynb are the 
original code outputs that I included while I was working just so I could compare my 
graphs and charts without them disappearing. They are empty cell blocks by-and-large. 
The .gitignore ignores where my api_keys were stored as well as the automatically 
created pycache folder. The Output Data folder contains the cities.csv and the four 
figures that were created by my code and necessary for the homework. Thank you for 
taking the time to grade my work and I hope that there are no outstanding problems.
